{"name":"HackerNews Follow Discussion Button","body":"### Welcome to the first version of the HackerNews Follow Discussion Button.\r\nBasically, this is plain vanilla. Just a .html and .css file.\r\n\r\n**What can the Button be used for?**\r\nI thought it a nice way for young startups or upcoming YC batches to setup a small link to their website related discussion on HackerNews (news.ycombinator.com). This is thought to be an alternative approach to the HN Submit and Counter Button (see https://github.com/igrigorik/hackernews-button). Alternative, as it only serves as a link to the discussion, that´s it.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@jermainkaminski on Twitter.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
